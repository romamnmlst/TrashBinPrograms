TrashBinPrograms

A collection of programs that delete and undelate files. Files that are deleted are first compressed, and then moved into 
a hidden .TrashCan directory. 

Del: Compresses a file, moves the compressed file to the .TrashCan directory, and deletes the original file.
Undel: Uncompresses the deleted file and restores the file to its original location. 
Show: Shows all of the files currently in the .TrashCan
Purge: Permanently deletes all files in the .TrashCan directory.
