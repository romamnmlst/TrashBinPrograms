TrashBinPrograms

A collection of programs that delete and undelate files. Files that are deleted are first compressed, and then moved into a hidden .TrashCan directory. 

Del: Compresses a file(s), moves the compressed file to the .TrashCan directory, and deletes the original file.
Undel: Uncompresses the deleted file(s) and restores the file to its original location. 
Show: Shows all of the files currently in the .TrashCan, or specific files.
Purge: Permanently deletes all files in the .TrashCan directory, or specific files.
